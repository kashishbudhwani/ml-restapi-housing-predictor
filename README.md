# ml-restapi-housing-predictor
A robust Python project demonstrating the deployment of a scikit-learn model (California Housing price predictor) as an accessible and documented REST API using FastAPI. End-to-end example of building a machine learning microservice: training the model, saving it with joblib, and serving predictions via a high-performance FastAPI endpoint.
